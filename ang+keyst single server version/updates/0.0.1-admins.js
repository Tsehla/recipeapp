    name :'Cheesy vegetable waffles' ,
    description : 'Waffles for lunch? Why not when they are these delicious savoury cheesy vegetable waffles? Add some bacon to the mix and lunch is ready!' ,
    ingredients : ['100 g fibre rich self raising flour','1/4 tsp baking powder','1/4 tsp salt','1 red chilli, deseeded and finely diced' ],
    method : `Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, paprika, chilli and parsley in a bowl.
In a jug, whisk together the eggs, buttermilk and butter.

Pour the wet ingredients into the flour and mix to combine.

Place the spiralised vegetables in a bowl and sprinkle over the extra dusting flour. This will help keep the vegetables separate and absorb excess water.

Add the vegetables and cheese to the batter and fold through.

Preheat the waffle iron. Brush with vegetable oil or spray the surface with non-stick spray.

Ladle in at least 2 heaped tablespoon amounts of batter for each waffle. Cook for at about 5-6 minutes until golden and crisp.

Repeat until all the batter is used up.

    name :'Chocolate cheese tart with dark chocolate ganache' ,
    description : 'As we said this is the perfect treat to celebrate World Chocolate Day. A chocolate cheese tart with dark chocolate ganache is best shared with friends.' ,
    ingredients : ['350 g flour','small pinch of salt','150 g unsalted butter','100 g icing sugar','2 large eggs - beaten' ],
    method : `To make the pastry: Sift the flour and salt onto your clean work surface and make a well in the middle. Put the butter in the centre and use your fingertips to work it into the flour until soft. Mix the icing sugar into the butter. 

Add the eggs to the butter and mix in. Start cutting the flour into the butter mixture slowly. Bring the mixture together with your hands, then knead a few times to make a smooth dough. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least an hour. 

Grease a 25 cm tart tin or pie dish. Roll the dough into a circle and line the tin. Preheat your oven to 180°C. Chill the pastry shell in the fridge for 20 minutes. 

Line the pastry with a piece of crumpled baking paper. Fill the paper with dried beans and bake for 10 minutes. Remove the beans and paper and bake the pastry for a further 5 minutes or until just cooked. 

While the pastry is baking prepare your filling. Place the eggs, sugar, vanilla and cream cheese in a bowl. Whisk until smooth. Add the melted dark chocolate and the sour cream and whisk again until everything is combined.

Reduce the oven temperature to 150°C. Pour the chocolate filling into the pastry shell and carefully transfer to the oven. Bake the tart for 1 hour, or until set. Leave to cool completely.

To make the ganache: place the chopped dark chocolate in a small bowl. Heat the cream until it just reaches boiling point, then pour the hot cream over the chocolate. Leave to stand for a minute, then whisk until smooth and glossy. Leave to cool for 5 minutes.

Pour the ganache over the cold tart and spread with a spatula. Leave to set. (You can put the tart in the fridge if you’re in a hurry or if it’s a hot day.) Decorate, slice and serve.Store the tart in the fridge.
